Being able to identify your problem, formulate it and find the right approach, is a big part of being a software developer!

Each assignment has its own subfolder where you will find a Readme specifying the task and a project folder of the language of your choice - Java or C#. 

For C# a solution file with a project for each assignment is located in the "source" folder.

For Java individual src files are provided for each assignment.
